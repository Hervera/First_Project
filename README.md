# Mario Sokoban
Mario Sokoban is a 2D game written in C programming and inspired by the iconic Japanese game, Sokoban.

Your mission: aid Mario in expertly shifting boxes to precise positions across an extensive array of 200 levels.

The inspiration for this innovative creation stems from the remarkable "Openclassrooms" platform, designed to introduce programming languages to beginners. I personally honed my C skills there: https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-c.
